# Plus4Serial
Plus4Serial is an Open Hardware Serial Port Adapter that plugs into the Commodore Plus/4 User Port, turning it into a fully-functional [RS-232 interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232).

## Summary
The Plus/4 User Port has all the signals required by an RS-232 interface, but they are at TTL voltage levels (i.e.: 0/+5V). In order to turn them into a real RS-232 port, they need to be shifted to higher voltages, which is the purpose of this board.

All the signals available on the DE-9 port are translated and usable: RXD, TXD, RTS, CTS, DTR, DSR and DCD. The only exception is RI (Ring Indicator), which is left unconnected.

The board plugs in the User Port, which means that it can also be used on a C16 or C116 through [a User Port card](https://github.com/SukkoPera/16up).

## Notes
This board uses a MAX238 chip for the level shifting, which is nice because it only needs a +5VDC voltage supply. The 9VAC supply available on the User Port is therefore not used. You can find used ones from China easily and cheaply.

If you have an older version of the board with a CTS/_CTS jumper, place it in the _CTS position, as it's the only correct one.

If you are looking for a terminal emulator, I recommend [Term-80](https://plus4world.powweb.com/software/Term-80_English) as it is hands down the most feature-rich program of its kind (Hint: press <kbd>CBM+H</kbd> when you get lost) and supports communication at 19200 bps (Take that, C64!).

## Releases
If you want to get this board produced, you are recommended to get [the latest release](https://github.com/SukkoPera/Plus4Serial/releases) rather than the current git version, as the latter might be under development and is not guaranteed to be working.

Every release is accompanied by its Bill Of Materials (BOM) file and any relevant notes about it, which you are recommended to read carefully.

## Thanks
* TLC (Levente HÃ¡rsfalvi) for lots of information about the serial port.
* The 3D model of the User Port connector was grabbed from [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/commodore-c64-userport-connector-1) but unfortunately the link now seems dead and I don't know who should be credited for it.
