# Plus4Serial
Plus4Serial is an Open Hardware Serial Port Adapter that plugs into the Commodore Plus/4 User Port, turning it into a fully-functional RS-232 interface.

## Summary
The +4 User Port has all the signals required by an RS-232 interface, but they are at TTL voltage levels (i.e.: 0/+5V). In order to turn them into a real RS-232 port, they need to be shifted to higher voltages, which is the purpose of this board.

All the signals available on the DB-9 port are translated and usable: RXD, TXD, RTS, CTS, DTR, DSR and DCD. The only exception is RI (Ring Indicator), which is left unconnected.

## Notes
This board uses a MAX238 chip for the level shifting, which is nice because it only needs a +5VDC voltage supply. The 9VAC supply available on the User Port is therefore not used. You can find used ones from China easily and cheaply.

If you are looking for a terminal emulator, I recommend [Term-80](https://plus4world.powweb.com/software/Term-80_English) as it is hands down the most feature-rich program of its kind (Hint: press <kbd>CBM+H</kbd> when you get lost) and supports communication at 19200 bps (Take that, C64!).

## Thanks
* TLC (Levente HÃ¡rsfalvi) for lots of information about the serial port.
* The 3D model of the User Port connector was grabbed from [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/commodore-c64-userport-connector-1) but unfortunately the link now seems dead and I don't know who should be credited for it.
